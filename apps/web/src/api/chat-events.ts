/**
 * Unified chat event log endpoint.

 * `GET /api/chats/:chatId/events`
 *
 * Single subscription replacing the legacy
 * `loadMessages → connectToRunningStream → reconnectToStream` dance on the
 * client. Behaviour:
 *
 *   1. **Subscription open.** Emit a `subscription-opened` event with current
 *      session id + task-running flag. The client uses this as the "first
 *      paint" signal — indicator can show immediately even before a single
 *      content event has arrived.
 *
 *   2. **Replay.** Translate buffered events past `Last-Event-ID` into
 *      `ChatEvent` payloads and emit them. If the buffer doesn't cover the
 *      requested range and the session has JSONL on disk, page in JSONL
 *      with synthetic event ids that sort before the buffer's first event.
 *
 *   3. **Live tail.** Subscribe to `task-service` broadcasts + queued-message
 *      updates; translate each to `ChatEvent` and emit live.
 *
 *   4. **Close.** When the task transitions to completed/error AND the
 *      queue is empty, close the stream so the client can release the
 *      connection. The client re-opens on next interaction.
 *
 * Differences from the legacy `task-stream.ts` GET handler:
 *
 *   - No 204 path. Even idle chats return 200 with an empty replay + a
 *     `subscription-opened` event.
 *   - Native SSE `id:` framing for `Last-Event-ID`, not embedded payload.
 *   - One closed `ChatEvent` schema, no `INTERNAL_CHUNK_TYPES` filtering.
 *   - Queue mutations are part of the stream (`queue-updated` events).

  //     rare case where the buffer has rotated past the cursor.
  //
  //   • Cold subscribe (`afterEventId` undefined) — replay the FULL
  //     session history. JSONL is authoritative here: the agent flushes
  //     every turn's user-message, tool calls and assistant text to it
  //     incrementally, so it covers prior turns the in-memory buffer
  //     may have lost (server restarts, session-switch, …). The buffer
  //     overlaps with JSONL on the latest turn, so when JSONL has any
  //     content we trust it as the source of truth and skip the buffer
  //     replay to avoid duplicating events. Without this split, picking
  //     a session from history and submitting a message ended up with
  //     only the last turn visible after a page refresh — the buffer
  //     had the new turn and the older JSONL history was elided.
  if (afterEventId === undefined) {
    // Cold subscribe — replay full session history.

    // PREFERENCE ORDER:
    //   1. In-memory buffer when it covers the session from event 1.
    //      Buffer events carry their real `eventId`s, so after this
    //      cold subscribe the client's `state.lastEventId` lines up
    //      with the buffer's natural numbering. Any reconnect then
    //      arrives with a cursor at the buffer's tail, and the
    //      `evt.eventId <= afterEventId` filter on the buffer-replay
    //      path naturally drops every event the client already has —
    //      no duplication on workspace switch.
    //
    //      Compare this to the JSONL path below: JSONL events carry
    //      *synthetic* negative ids (so they sort below live buffer
    //      ids on this single subscription), but those negative ids
    //      never move the client's `Math.max(state.lastEventId ?? 0,
    //      eventId)` cursor above 0. The next reconnect then sends
    //      `lastEventId=0`, and the server's buffer replay re-emits
    //      every event from id 1 onward — producing the
    //      "switch-back-doubles-the-conversation" bug.
    //   2. JSONL backfill for sessions whose buffer is missing or
    //      partial (server restart, rotation past the start).
    //   3. Buffer-as-fallback for the rare case JSONL fails *and* the
    //      buffer is partial — emits what we can.
    // Use `?? Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` (not `?? 0`) for the
    // missing-eventId fallback so a malformed buffer entry with no
    // eventId does NOT spoof `bufferCoversStart`. If we let it
