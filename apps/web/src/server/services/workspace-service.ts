   *      optional base branch).
   *   2. Persists the new worktree row through `saveState`.
   *   3. Materialises the workspace's default chat pane.
   *   4. Kicks off the workspace's `.band/setup` script in the background.
   *      If a `prompt` was supplied, the task is submitted only after the
   *      setup script finishes (so the coding agent sees its dependencies
   *      installed). When there is no setup script, the task is dispatched
   *      synchronously.
   *
   * Dispatch target (`input.via`, issue #551):
   *   - `"chat"` (default when absent) — submit the prompt to the workspace's
   *     default chat pane via `taskService.submitTask`.
   *   - `"terminal"` — resolve the chosen agent's interactive CLI invocation
   *     (`adapter.cliInvocation(prompt)`) and spawn it in a fresh terminal
   *     pane via `terminalService.spawn`. The pane id is returned alongside
   *     the worktree path so callers (the Rust CLI in particular) can wire
   *     follow-up commands directly to the new pane.
   *
   *   When the resolved adapter doesn't expose a vendor CLI for terminal
   *   dispatch (e.g. cursor-cli today), the service logs a warning and
   *   falls back to `"chat"` so the create call still succeeds. The
   *   response then carries `via: "chat"` and no `terminalId`.
   *
   * **`terminalId` is a *reserved* id, not a guarantee.** When dispatch
   * resolves to `"terminal"`, the service generates the id up front and
   * includes it in the response, but `terminalService.spawn` runs
   * asynchronously inside `onSetupComplete` — the spawn may still fail
   * (cwd missing, shell binary absent, EAGAIN, …). Failures are logged
   * and the `terminal-created` event simply never fires; the dashboard
   * will not see a panel materialise. Callers scripting on `terminalId`
   * should treat it as "the pane the server will try to spawn", not
   * "the pane that already exists". The terminal-created / terminal-killed
   * event stream is the authoritative liveness signal.
   *
   * On the **idempotent path** (the workspace's branch already exists as
   * a worktree row), the method returns just `{ ok: true, path }` —
   * `via` and `terminalId` are omitted because no fresh dispatch
   * happened. The Rust CLI propagates that absence so a caller can
   * distinguish "newly created + dispatched" from "already existed,
